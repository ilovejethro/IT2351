There are several things to consider when deleting a customer from the customer's table. First, if you aren't completely certain, you might want to test out the delete on a copy of the table. Also, you could first code a select statement to make sure you have identified the correct customer.
If multiple other people are using the database, any changes you make could affect their work as well. That is why making a copy of the table first or being absolutely certain you are selecting the correct information is so important.
You will have to make sure MySQL Workbench is not in safe update mode. If it is, you will have to go to preferences to turn that off.
If the where clause is omitted, you could end up accidentallyl deleting all row in the table.
Since customer_id is a foreign key in the orders table, the orders corresponding to the customer_id would have to be deleted from the orders table first. The order_id of any order from that customer_id would also be used to identify related rows in the order_details table. These rows would have to be deleted as well before deleting a customer.
